			<h1>Sanjana Bhatia</h1>
			<h2><a href="project.html">Tale of Three Cities</a></h2>
			<p> I want to create an interactive story about myself, essentially. I have moved around so much in my life, and had a chance to be a part of so many cultures, groups and settings.
				It would be interesting if I could translate this experience to a digital curation that explains three cities that define me: London, Jakarta and Hong Kong. I want to have visual graphics that delineate the difference of maturity within me, a contrast of feeling, of warmth, of creativity. Rather than an external visualization of three places, it is a visual interpretation of the internal. </p>

			<h3>Sketches and Research </h3>

			<a href="http://cuppetellimendoza.com/nervous-structure-field/"> inspo for graphic </a>
			<p> LONDON: Very playful, childish, girly (pinks) - images and icons that spread across the page and shake and vibrate when clicked </p>
			<p> HONG KONG: Isolation, contemplation, coldness (shades of blues) - shards of images and shapes, sharp and jutting across the page. Shattering glass - sound  </p>
			<p> JAKARTA: warmth, family, friendship (greens, yellows, orange) - create a graphic made up of fluid lines that moves and bends as the mouse rolls over it  </p>
